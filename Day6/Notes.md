- The last entry in the for-loop can be omitted using syntax `1..<n` instead of `1...n-1`
- Value can be ignored using `_` in the for-loop `for _ in 1..<n`
- Range operator `...` and `..<` can be used to create a range of values, e.g. `array[1...5]` and `array[1...]`
- `Int.random(in: n...m)` can be used to generate random number between n and m
- `break` and `continue` can be used to break out of the loop or skip some iterations
