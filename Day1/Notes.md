- Swift was launched in 2014
- SwiftUI was launched in 2019 (UIKit was used before that)
- Camel case is a convention (firstName, lastName, etc.)
- Decimals and Integers can not be added together straight away
- Swift is a type safe language, e.g.:

```swift
    var age: Int = 25
    age = 13 // This is ok
    age = "30" // This will throw an error
```
